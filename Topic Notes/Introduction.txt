VUE JS: 
------

- JS runs on browser. This enables us to change the UI WHILE the 
user is using the app WITHOUT fetching the data from a server. 

- JS framework that enables building interactive and reactive 
 web frontends. 

- mostly a frontend framework. (Helps in writing better frontend
code)

- Framework is third party library which: 
a. exposes certain utility functions and API to work with. 
b. Provides a certain structure/set of rules on how to build apps
using that framework

- Framework = library + set of instructions on building apps

WHY? to use : 
- Without frameworks/libraries we'd have to reinvent the wheel. 
- not everyone writes code with same structure & philosophy.
- chances of sub-optimal code increase. 

Ways of utilizing VUE: 
---------------------- 

a. for controlling parts of HTML page or entire page 
b. for controlling the ENTIRE FRONTEND.  

NOTE: 
Vanilla JS -> Imperative Syntax => specify each step. 

Vue.js -> Declarative Syntax => specify end-result and
          data only.  

HOW Vue works ? 

- We use declarative form of programming. We connect the 
HTML to the DATA and LOGIC managed in the VUE app by 
ADDING special FEATURES to the HTML code. 

- These features aren't supported by HTML but only
 understood by the VUE app.
