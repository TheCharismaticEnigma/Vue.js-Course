Asynchronous programming with Vue.js : 
------------------------------------- 

- In reality, data isn't stored in browsers, but it's stored 
in servers owned by the developer. 
- The application running on user's browser should fetch data 
and then render the application. 

- ex. Amazon.com's products are stored on amazon's servers. 

- for writing server-side code (code that doesn't run in browser)
and connecting course to data-base, 
node.js.


- USE FIREBASE INSTEAD: 
----------------------- 

- service provided by google. 
- like having own server and logic. 
It is our own personal backend, without writing backend code. 
As backend code is already configured

- Use data-base servide from firebase. It has REST API, an interface
to which we can send HTTP request for data. 

NOTE: HTTP request should be sent without RESTARTING the 
application. 

NOTE: 
- We send a request to some data base code written by firebase team
that code parses our request, extracts the data, and writes it 
to realtime data-base. (we don't interact with data-base). 
- add /identifier.json to URL for firebase requirements. 


NOTE: HOW? to send HTTP request ? 

- third-party packages like AXIOUS are useful for sending HTTP request 
from inside JS. 

- fetch() api from browser. 

TOPIC : POST request to store data: 
- pass another object to fetch() function to configure the request.
- 
fetch('....', {
    method: 'POST', 

    headers: { 
        'Content-Type': 'application/json', 
    }, 

    body: JSON.stringify({
        name: this.enteredName, 
        rating:......
    })
}) ;
